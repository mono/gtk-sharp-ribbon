<h2 id="jgir">Issues</h2>
<h3 id="srhl">Size negotiations</h3>
The Gtk+ layout system processes in two passes: 1) size request 2) size allocation. However, in most widgets, it would be great to negotiate the size request based on size constraints (i.e. given a specific height constraint, return a width request). Currently, HeightRequest and WidthRequest properties are often used to bypass this.<br id="hu:g">
<h3 id="hu:g0">Transparency</h3>
The Ribbon specification requires many widgets to be transparent. However, the Gtk+ officialy requires a 'composited' desktop to support this. Nevertheless, composited desktop is still rare. In addition, the implementation of key tips requires to be able to display tiny labels on top of all widgets, and regardless of widgets' boundaries (most key tip must be displayed between two adjacent widgets). This would require many small windows to be created, or a single transparent one to be created. Currently, all widgets are used in window-less mode. Consequently, they all share the same window. However, it also disrupts the dispatchs of Gtk+ events. That's why the Ribbon library contains the SyntheticWindow class, which takes care of dispatching events to window-less widgets.<br id="qhys">
<h3 id="vkzc">Key bindings</h3>
The Ribbon library must be able to retrieve the keyboard shortcut of accelerators in order to display the key associated to each widget. The solution to this problem is still obscure.<br id="m:yx">
<h2 id="tidz">Windows' drop shadow</h2>
We should have the ability to disable drop shadow on certain window because it breaks the visual style of the Ribbon.<br id="wn_q">
